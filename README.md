# ratpenat

I created this theme from the [blank](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/blank/) theme
with inspiration from several other themes, for example:
* [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/)
* [MinIndie](https://git.sr.ht/~bacardi55/MinIndie)
* [Archie](https://github.com/athul/archie)
* [smol](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/smol/)

This is a theme tailored for my personal use in [my blog](https://quiroptero.blog).
As a result it might be heavily hardcoded, opinionated and filled with dirty solutions.
Mistakes, if any, are mine and not those I have borrowed ideas from.

The creation of this theme aims to achieve the following objectives:

* It's easy to understand (for me).
* Prefer, when possible, specific layouts rather than general ones.
* It's overall structure is simple.
* It's sparse: nothing that I do not specifically need won't be included.
* Reduce the number of variables that I need to run my site
